# PHP-DBAPI

A bulletproof PHP MySQL API.

## Features

- Used to make millions of SQL requests every day
- Neither tools nor experts managed to perform unwanted SQL commands with PHP-DBAPI in the backend
- Leverages the MySQL Native Driver for high performance
  - Speaking of which, if you're still using PHP 5 — which you shouldn't — you need to install it first: `apt-get install php5-mysqlnd`
