# smw, the simple & secure mysqli wrapper

A simple and secure wrapper for interacting with MySQL servers.

We've been using smw in our backend for years and neither tools nor experts managed to perform unwanted SQL commands.

## Usage

If you're using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), you can simply `composer require hell-sh/smw`

Further information can be found [here](https://github.com/hell-sh/smw/blob/master/example.php).
